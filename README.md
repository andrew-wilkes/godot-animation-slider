# Animation Slider Plugin

Synchronize an animation player position with a position input value.

This forces a transition between points in the animation rather than sudden jumps due to erratic position inputs.

The demo shows an HSlider being used to move a Sprite whose position is determined by an animation track.

An export var stores a reference to the Slider node.

The target position is in the range 0 .. 1.

## Usage

* Install the plugin.
* Add an AnimationSlider node to your scene
* Create an animation
* Write code to affect the target_position input or use a H or V slider
